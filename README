=== WHAT IS RETTER? ===========================================================

    The purpose of this project is to promote and develop cryptography.

    It includes the collection of known tools, libraries, articles, materials,
    hash functions, and ciphers. Also it's a place for people who share an
    interest in security & cryptography and want to discuss about it.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | If you invent a new hash function or ciphers, or write a paper related |
    | to cryptography just add it here. That is the right place...           |
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    See CONTRIBUTING file in main directory.

=== HOW DO I BUILD RETTER? ====================================================

    The retter code has been tested on Debian Linux, using the Python 2.7.

    ./bootstrap.sh build

=== WHERE CAN I FIND UPDATES? =================================================
