description: 'AES is based on the Rijndael cipher developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, who submitted a proposal to NIST during the AES selection process. Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes.'
information:
  published: "1998"
  structure: Substitution-permutation network
authors:
- Joan Daemen
- Vincent Rijmen
labels: Symmetric-Key Primitives, Block Ciphers
cryptanalysis: 'Until May 2009, the only successful published attacks against the full AES were side-channel attacks on some specific implementations.'
