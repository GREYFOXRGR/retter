name: Adler-32
description: 'Compared to a cyclic redundancy check of the same length, it trades
  reliability for speed. Adler-32 is more reliable than Fletcher-16, and slightly
  less reliable than Fletcher-32.'

cryptanalysis: ' Jonathan Stone discovered in 2001 that Adler-32 has a weakness for
  very short messages. He wrote "Briefly, the problem is that, for very short packets,
  Adler-32 is guaranteed to give poor coverage of the available bits. Don''t take
  my word for it, ask Mark Adler :-)"'
