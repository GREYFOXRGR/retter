description: "Blum Blum Shub is a pseudorandom number generator proposed in 1986 by Lenore Blum, Manuel Blum and Michael Shub that is derived from Michael O. Rabin's oblivious transfer mapping."

cryptanalysis: 'There is a proof reducing its security to the computational difficulty of solving the Quadratic residuosity problem. A serious problem is very slow computing.'
