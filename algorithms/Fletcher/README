description: ' The Fletcher checksum is an algorithm for computing a position-dependent
  checksum. The objective of the Fletcher checksum was to provide error-detection
  properties approaching those of a cyclic redundancy check but with the lower computational
  effort associated with summation techniques.'

cryptanalysis: ' The Fletcher checksum cannot distinguish between blocks of all 0
  bits and blocks of all 1 bits. For example, if a 16-bit block in the data word changes
  from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF, the Fletcher-32 checksum remains the same. This also means
  a sequence of all 00 bytes has the same checksum as a sequence (of the same size)
  of all FF bytes.'
