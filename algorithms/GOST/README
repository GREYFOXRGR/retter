name: GOST
description: ' The GOST hash function, defined in the standards GOST R 34.11-94 and
  GOST 34.311-95, is a 256-bit cryptographic hash function. It was initially defined
  in the Russian national standard GOST R 34.11-94 Information Technology - Cryptographic
  Information Security - Hash Function. The equivalent standard used by other member-states
  of the CIS is GOST 34.311-95.'

cryptanalysis: ' In 2008, an attack was published that breaks the full-round GOST
  hash function. The paper presents a collision attack in 2^105 time, and first and
  second preimage attacks in 2^192 time (2^n time refers to the approximate number
  of times the algorithm was calculated in the attack).'
