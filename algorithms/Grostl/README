description: !!python/str " Gr\xF8stl is a cryptographic hash function submitted to\
  \ the NIST hash function competition by Praveen Gauravaram, Lars Knudsen, Krystian\
  \ Matusiewicz, Florian Mendel, Christian Rechberger, Martin Schl\xE4ffer, and S\xF8\
  ren S. Thomsen. Gr\xF8stl was chosen as one of the five finalists of the competition.\
  \ It uses the same S-box as AES in a custom construction. The authors claim speeds\
  \ of up to 21.4 cycles per byte on an Intel Core 2 Duo."
