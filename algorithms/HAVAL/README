name: HAVAL
description: ' HAVAL is a cryptographic hash function. Unlike MD5, but like most modern
  cryptographic hash functions, HAVAL can produce hashes of different lengths. HAVAL
  can produce hashes in lengths of 128 bits, 160 bits, 192 bits, 224 bits, and 256
  bits. HAVAL also allows users to specify the number of rounds (3, 4, or 5) to be
  used to generate the hash.'

cryptanalysis: ' Research has uncovered weaknesses which make further use of HAVAL
  (at least the variant with 128 bits and 3 passes with 2^6 operations) questionable.
  On 17 August 2004, collisions for HAVAL (128 bits, 3 passes) were announced by Xiaoyun
  Wang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Hongbo Yu.'
