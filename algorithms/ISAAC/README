name: ISAAC
description: 'ISAAC is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator and a stream cipher. The algorithm has similarities with RC4.'
information:
  published: "1996"
  sizes: arbitrary
  structure: indirection, shift, accumulate, add, and count
authors:
- Robert J. Jenkins Jr.
labels: Symmetric-Key Primitives, Stream Ciphers, Pseudorandom Generators
cryptanalysis: 'Marina Pudovkina attack (2001) can recover the initial state with a complexity that is approximated to be less than the time needed for searching through the square root of all possible initial states.'
