name: MD2
description: ' The MD2 Message-Digest Algorithm is a cryptographic hash function.
  The algorithm is optimized for 8-bit computers. Although MD2 is no longer considered
  secure, even as of 2014, it remains in use in public key infrastructures as part
  of certificates generated with MD2 and RSA.'

cryptanalysis: ' Rogier and Chauvaud (1997) described collisions of MD2''s compression
  function, although they were unable to extend the attack to the full MD2. In 2009,
  security updates were issued disabling MD2 in OpenSSL, GnuTLS, and Network Security
  Services.'
