name: MD4
description: ' The MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm is a cryptographic hash function.
  The digest length is 128 bits. The algorithm has influenced later designs, such
  as the MD5, SHA-1 and RIPEMD algorithms.'

cryptanalysis: ' The security of MD4 has been severely compromised. The first full
  collision attack against MD4 was published in 1995 and several newer attacks have
  been published since then. As of 2007, an attack can generate collisions in less
  than 2 hash operations. A theoretical preimage attack also exists.'
