name: MD5
description: ' The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash
  function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format
  as a 32 digit hexadecimal number. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of cryptographic
  applications, and is also commonly used to verify data integrity.'
