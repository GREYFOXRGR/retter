name: MD6
description: ' The MD6 Message-Digest Algorithm is a cryptographic hash function.
  It uses a Merkle tree-like structure to allow for immense parallel computation of
  hashes for very long inputs. Authors claim a performance of 28 cycles per byte for
  MD6-256 on an Intel Core 2 Duo and provable resistance against differential cryptanalysis.'
