name: RC4
description: 'In cryptography, RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4 also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is a stream cipher.'
information:
  published: "1987"
authors:
- Ron Rivest
labels: Symmetric-Key Primitives, Stream Ciphers
cryptanalysis: 'RC4 does not take a separate nonce alongside the key. This means that if a single long-term key is to be used to securely encrypt multiple streams, the protocol must specify how to combine the nonce and the long-term key to generate the stream key for RC4.'
