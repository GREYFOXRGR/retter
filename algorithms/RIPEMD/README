name: RIPEMD
description: ' RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest) is a family
  of cryptographic hash functions developed in Leuven, Belgium, by Hans Dobbertin,
  Antoon Bosselaers and Bart Preneel at the COSIC research group at the Katholieke
  Universiteit Leuven, and first published in 1996. RIPEMD was based upon the design
  principles used in MD4, and is similar in performance to the more popular SHA-1.'
