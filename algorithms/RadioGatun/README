description: !!python/str " RadioGat\xFAn is a cryptographic hash primitive created\
  \ by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Micha\xEBl Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. It was\
  \ first publicly presented at the NIST Second Cryptographic Hash Workshop, held\
  \ in Santa Barbara, California, on August 24\u201325, 2006, as part of the NIST\
  \ hash function competition."

cryptanalysis: 'The most effective attack against the algorithm with a complexity of 2^11 is given in the paper "Cryptanalysis of RadioGatun" by Thomas Fuhr and Thomas Peyrin. While more effective than the other attacks this attack still does not break the security claim.'
