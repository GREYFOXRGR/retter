cryptanalysis: ' As of 2012, the most efficient attack against SHA-1 is considered
  to be the one by Marc Stevens with an estimated cost of $2.77M to break a single
  hash value by renting CPU power from cloud servers. Stevens developed this attack
  in a project called HashClash, implementing a differential path attack. On 8 November
  2010, he claimed he had a fully working near-collision attack against full SHA-1
  working with an estimated complexity equivalent to 2^57.5 SHA-1 compressions. He
  estimates this attack can be extended to a full collision with a complexity around
  2^61.'
