name: SWIFFT
description: ' In cryptography, SWIFFT is a collection of provably secure hash functions.
  It is based on the concept of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). SWIFFT is not the
  first hash function based on FFT, but it sets itself apart by providing a mathematical
  proof of its security. It also uses the LLL basis reduction algorithm.'

cryptanalysis: ' Known working attacks are: Generalized Birthday Attack, which takes
  2^106 operations and inversion attacks which takes 2^448 operations for a standard
  parameter choice. This is usually considered to be enough to render an attack by
  an adversary infeasible.'
