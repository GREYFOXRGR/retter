description: ' The SYSV checksum algorithm is commonly used, legacy checksum algorithms.
  It has been implemented in UNIX System V and is also available through the GNU sum
  command line utility.'
information:
  sizes: 16 bits
  structure: CRC

labels: Unkeyed Primitives, Hash Functions (MDCs), Cyclic Redundancy Checks
cryptanalysis: ' Re-arranging the same bytes in another order does not change the
  checksum. Increasing one byte and decreasing another byte by the same amount does
  not change the checksum. Adding or removing zero bytes does not change the checksum.'
