name: Skein
description: ' Skein is a cryptographic hash function and one of five finalists in
  the NIST hash function competition. Entered as a candidate to become the SHA-3 standard,
  the successor of SHA-1 and SHA-2, it ultimately lost to NIST hash candidate Keccak.'

cryptanalysis: ' In October 2010, an attack that combines rotational cryptanalysis
  with the rebound attack was published. The attack finds rotational collisions for
  53 of 72 rounds in Threefish-256, and 57 of 72 rounds in Threefish-512. It also
  affects the Skein hash function. This is a follow-up to the earlier attack published
  in February, which breaks 39 and 42 rounds respectively.'
