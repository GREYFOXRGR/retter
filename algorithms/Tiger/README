name: Tiger
description: ' In cryptography, Tiger is a cryptographic hash function designed by
  Ross Anderson and Eli Biham in 1995 for efficiency on 64-bit platforms. The size
  of a Tiger hash value is 192 bits. Truncated versions (known as Tiger/128 and Tiger/160)
  can be used for compatibility with protocols assuming a particular hash size. Unlike
  the SHA-2 family, no distinguishing initialization values are defined; they are
  simply prefixes of the full Tiger/192 hash value.'

cryptanalysis: ' John Kelsey and Stefan Lucks have found a collision-finding attack
  on 16-round Tiger with a time complexity equivalent to about 2^44 compression function
  invocations and another attack that finds pseudo-near collisions in 20-round Tiger
  with work less than that of 2^48 compression function invocations. Florian Mendel
  et al. have improved upon these attacks by describing a collision attack spanning
  19 rounds of Tiger, and a 22-round pseudo-near-collision attack. These attacks require
  a work effort equivalent to about 2^62 and 2^44 evaluations of the Tiger compression
  function, respectively.'
