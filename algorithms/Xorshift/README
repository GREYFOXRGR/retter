name: Xorshift
description: 'Xorshift random number generators are a class of pseudorandom number generators that was discovered by George Marsaglia.'
information:
  published: July 2003
  sizes: 16, 32, 64, 128 bits
  structure: xor/shift
authors:
- George Marsaglia
labels: Pseudorandom Generators
cryptanalysis: 'They are a subclass of linear feedback shift registers, but their simple implementation typically makes them faster and use less space.'
